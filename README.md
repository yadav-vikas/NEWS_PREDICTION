Text data requires special preparation before you can start using it for predictive modeling.

The text must be parsed to remove words, called tokenization. Then the words need to be encoded as integers or floating point values for use as input to a machine learning algorithm, called feature extraction (or vectorization).

The scikit-learn library offers easy-to-use tools to perform both tokenization and feature extraction of your text data.
